<h1>Songs of Love</h1>
<h2>(Divine Comedy)</h2>
<p>[C] Pale pubescent [F] beasts</p>
<p>roam through the [G] streets and coffee [Am] shops</p>
<p>Their [Dm] prey gather in [F] herds</p>
<p>with stiff knee length [Eb] skirts and white ankle [C#9]
socks</p>
<p>But [C] while they search for a [F] mate</p>
<p>my type hiber- [G] -nates in bedrooms a- [Am] -bove</p>
<p>Com- [D7] -posing their [F] songs [G] of [C] love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[C] Young, uniform [F] minds</p>
<p>in uniform [G] lines and uniform [Am] ties</p>
<p>Run [Dm] round with trousers on [F] fire</p>
<p>and signs of de- [Eb] -sire they cannot dis- [C#9] -guise</p>
<p>While [C] I try to find [F] words</p>
<p>as light as the [G] birds that circle a- [Am] -bove</p>
<p>To [D7] put in my [F] songs [G] of [C] love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ab] Fate doesn't [Bb9] hang on a [C] wrong or right [Am]
choice</p>
<p>[Ab] Fortune de- [Bb9] -pends on the [C] tone of your [G]
voice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So [C] sing while you have [F] time</p>
<p>Let the sun [G] shine down from [Am] above</p>
<p>And [D7] fill you with [F] songs [G] of [C] love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>(Intro riff can be played by adding 1st finger to the 1st fret of 2nd
string to create Csus4 and alternating it with C.)</h5>
<h5>(F can be replaced with F+9 – just remove yr 2nd finger from top string
&amp; play it as a one finger chord.)</h5>
<h5>(Some new chords here such as C#9 and Bb9. Play them using barres. Best way
to play Eb here though is without a barre, leaving the top string open)</h5>
