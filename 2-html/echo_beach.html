<h1>Echo Beach</h1>
<h2>(Martha and the Muffins)</h2>
<p>[Am] [G] [Em] [F] [G] x 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I [Am] know it's out of fashion, [D] and a [C] trifle [Am]
uncool, [D] [Em]</p>
<p>But [Am] I can't help it, [D] I'm a [C] romantic [Am] fool.
[D] [Em]</p>
<p>It's a [Am] habit of mine [D] to watch the [C] sun go [Am]
down. [D] [Em]</p>
<p>On [Am] Echo Beach, [D] I watch the [C] sun go [Am] down.
[D] [Em]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>From [G] 9 to five I have to spend my [D] time at work.</p>
<p>My [G] job is very boring I'm an [D] office clerk.</p>
<p>The [Am] only thing that helps me pass the [Em] time away</p>
<p>Is [Am] knowing I'll be back in Echo [Em] Beach some day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(with saxophone)</p>
<p>[Am] [G] [Em] [F] [G] x 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On [Am] silent summer evenings [D] the sky's [C] alive with
[Am] light. [D] [Em]</p>
<p>A [Am] building in the distance - [D] surreal [C] istic [Am]
sight. [D] [Em]</p>
<p>On [Am] Echo Beach, [D] waves make the [C] only [Am] sound.
[D] [Em]</p>
<p>On [Am] Echo Beach, [D] there's not a [C] soul a [Am] round.
[D] [Em]</p>

<p>[Am] Echo Beach [G] far away in time, [Em] Echo Beach [F]
far away [G] in time...</p>
