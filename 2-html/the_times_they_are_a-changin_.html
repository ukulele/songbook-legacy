<h1>The Times They Are a-Changin'</h1>
<h2>(Bob Dylan)</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come [G] gather round [Em] people [C] wherever you [G] roam</p>
<p>And [G] admit that the [Em] waters [C] around you have [D]
grown</p>
<p>And [G] accept it that [Em] soon you'll be [C] drenched to
the [G] bone</p>
<p>If your [G] time to [Am] you is worth [D] savin'</p>
<p>So you [D] better start [C] swimming or you'll [G] sink like
a [D] stone</p>
<p>For the [G] times, they [C] are a- [D] chang - [G] in'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come [G] writers and [Em] critics who [C] prophesise with
your [G] pen</p>
<p>And [G] keep your eyes [Em] wide the chance [C] won't come
[D] again</p>
<p>And [G] don't speak too [Em] soon for the wheel's [C] still
in [G] spin</p>
<p>And there's [G] no tellin' [Am] who that it's [D] namin'</p>
<p>For the [D] loser [C] now will be [G] later to [D] win</p>
<p>For the [G] times they [C] are a- [D] chang [G] in'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come [G] mothers and [Em] fathers [C] throughout the [G]
land</p>
<p>And [G] don't criti [Em] cize what you [C] don't under [D]
stand</p>
<p>Your [G] sons and your [Em] daughters are [C] beyond your
[G] command</p>
<p>Your [G] old road is [Am] rapidly [D] agin'</p>
<p>Please [D] get out of the [C] new one if you [G] can't lend
a [D] hand</p>
<p>For the [G] times they [C] are a- [D] chan [G] gin'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come [G] senators, [Em] congressmen [C] please heed the [G]
call</p>
<p>Don't [G] stand in the [Em] doorway, don't [C] block up the
[D] hall</p>
<p>For [G] he that gets [Em] hurt will be [C] he who has [G]
stalled</p>
<p>There's a [G] battle out [Am] side and it's [D] ragin'</p>
<p>It'll [D] soon shake your [C] windows and [G] rattle your
[D] walls</p>
<p>For the [G] times they [C] are a- [D] chang [G] in'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The [G] line it is [Em] drawn the [C] curse it is [G] cast</p>
<p>The [G] slow one [Em] now will [C] later be [D] fast</p>
<p>As the [G] present [Em] now will [C] later be [G] past</p>
<p>The [G] order is [Am] rapidly [D] fadin'</p>
<p>And the [D] first one [C] now will [G] later be [D] last</p>
<p>For the [G] times they [C] are a- [D] chang [G] in'</p>
