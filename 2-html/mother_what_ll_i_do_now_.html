<h1>Mother What'll I do Now?</h1>
<h2>(George Formby)</h2>
<p>[C] Mother you give good advice, [G7] always you mean well</p>
<p>[C] Now I [E7] need it [Am] more than ever [D7] I'm inside
this [G7] cell</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[C] I'm be- [A7] -hind a [Dm] prison [G7] wall</p>
<p>the [C] bed's too [A7] hard and [D7] much too [G7] small</p>
<p>There's [C] no py- [C7] -jamas [F] here at [Ab7] all</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>They [C] told me [A7] they would [Dm] treat me [G7] well</p>
<p>[C] Tucked in- [A7] -side my [D7] little [G7] cell</p>
<p>But [C] up to [C7] now it's [F] been like [Ab7] Hell</p>
<p>[G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're [C7] parted from each other, [F] and that's too bad</p>
<p>[D7] You're my favourite mother, oh the best I ever [G7] had</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To- [C] -night I've [A7] got a [Dm] date you [G7] see</p>
<p>but [C] they won't [A7] let me [D7] have a [G7] key</p>
<p>And the [C] warders [C7] won't wait [F] up for [Ab7] me</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>It's [C] hard to [A7] pass the [Dm] time a- [G7] -way</p>
<p>[C] I'm in a [A7] dangerous [D7] mood I [G7] say</p>
<p>I've [C] smoked two [C7] cigar- [F] -ettes to- [Ab7] -day</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>[C] First I [A7] stand and [Dm] then I [G7] sit</p>
<p>[C] Then I [A7] sit and [D7] stand a [G7] bit</p>
<p>But [C] I can't [C7] stand much [F] more of [Ab7] it</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're [C7] parted from each other, [F] and that's too bad</p>
<p>[D7] You're my favourite mother, oh the best I ever [G7] had</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[C] I got [A7] such an [Dm] awful [G7] shock</p>
<p>I [C] asked the [A7] time, for [D7] there's no [G7] clock</p>
<p>And the [C] warder [C7] said &quot;Six [F] months, old [Ab7]
cock!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>I [C] ordered [A7] lunch from [Dm] soup to [G7] sweet</p>
<p>but [C] they foR- [A7] -got the [D7] fish and [G7] meat</p>
<p>And [C] since the [C7] soup there's [F] nowt to [Ab7] eat</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>[C] I've had [A7] such a [Dm] tummy [G7] ache</p>
<p>[C] All night [A7] long I've [D7] been a- [G7] -wake</p>
<p>Some [C] castor [C7] oil they [F] made me [Ab7] take</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're [C7] parted from each other, [F] and that's too bad</p>
<p>[D7] You're my favourite mother, oh the best I ever [G7] had</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[C] I've played [A7] &quot;Peter, [Dm] fly away [G7]
Paul&quot;</p>
<p>[C] I've played [A7] tiddlywinks [D7] an' [G7] all</p>
<p>I've [C] written rude [C7] words up- [F] -on the [Ab7] wall</p>
<p>Oh [G7] Mother what'll I do [C] now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>(Ab7 is basically G7 played one fret higher and with the top string
fingered at the 1st fret.)</h5>
<h6>(In George Formby's recorded version the word &quot;Hell&quot; is replaced
by a humorous parping noise. Modern sensibilities being what they are we could
consider this optional)</h6>
