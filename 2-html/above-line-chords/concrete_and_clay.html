<p class=Chords>G7                        C</p>
<p>You to me, are sweet as roses in the morning</p>
<p class=Chords>     G7                          C                  F</p>
<p>And you to me, are soft as summer rains that fall in love we
share</p>
<p class=Chords>      Em</p>
<p>That something rare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p class=Chords>     Dm</p>
<p>The sidewalks in the street</p>
<p class=Chords>     G7                                    C                 Am</p>
<p>The concrete and the clay beneath my feet begins to crumble</p>
<p class=Chords>          F                  G7</p>
<p>But love will never die</p>
<p class=Chords>                   C                    Am</p>
<p>Because we'll see the mountains tumble</p>
<p class=Chords>        F                 G7</p>
<p>Before we say goodbye</p>
<p class=Chords>                  F          E7            G7</p>
<p>My love and I will be in love eternally</p>
<p class=Chords>G7                           C</p>
<p>That's the way, hmm that's the way it's meant to be</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>G7                    C</p>
<p>All around I see the purple shades of evening</p>
<p class=Chords>    G7                                     C                  F</p>
<p>And on the ground, the shadows fall and once again you're in
my arms</p>
<p class=Chords>    Em</p>
<p>So tenderly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>       G7</p>
<p>And that's the way</p>
<p class=Chords>          C</p>
<p>That's the way it's meant to be</p>
<p class=Chords>G7</p>
<p>That's the way</p>
<p class=Chords>          C</p>
<p>That's the way it's meant to be</p>
<p class=Chords>G7</p>
<p>That's the way</p>
<p class=Chords>          C</p>
<p>That's the way it's meant to be</p>
