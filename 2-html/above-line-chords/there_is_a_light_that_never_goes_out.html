<p>Where there's music and there's people, and they're young

<p class=Chords>Am           G      Am      G       F                C</p>

home</p>
<p class=Chords>G           Am           G      Am      G      F           C  G</p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p class=Chords>Dm           F      G      C           Am</p>
<p>            And if a double-decker bus</p>
<p>F</p>
<p>Crashes into us</p>
<p class=Chords>G                C                F           Dm</p>
<p>  To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die</p>
<p class=Chords>            C      Am      F</p>
<p>And if a ten-ton truck  kills the both of us</p>
<p class=Chords>G              C                F                Dm</p>
<p>  To die by your side, Well the pleasure, the privilege is
mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Am           G      Am      G      F      C</p>

C  G</p>
<p>Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care</p>
<p class=Chords>         Am                G          Am            G</p>
<p>And in the darkened underpass          I thought</p>
<p class=Chords>          F                      C      G</p>
<p>&quot;Oh god, my chance has come at last&quot;</p>
<p class=Chords>         Am                  G            Am            G     
F      C  G</p>
<p>But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't  ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Am           G      Am      G      F      C</p>

C  G</p>
<p>Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care</p>
<p class=Chords>Am           G      Am      G</p>
<p>Driving in your car</p>
<p class=Chords>  F                C</p>
<p>I never, never want to go home</p>
<p class=Chords>        G           Am      G      Am</p>
<p>Because I haven't got one, da da dum ...</p>
<p class=Chords>G                F           C  G</p>
<p>Oh, I haven't got one</p>
