<h2>(Kraftwerk)</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p class=Chords>Am  Em x 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                    Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>She's a model and she's looking good</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                        Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>I'd like to take her home that's understood</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                              Em       Am       Em</p>
<p>She plays hard to get, she smiles from time to time</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                    Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>It only takes a camera to change her mind</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>C  Bm  G</p>
<p class=Chords>C  Bm  E</p>

<p class=Chords>Am                              Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>She's going out tonight, loves drinking just champagne</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                           Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>And she has been checking nearly all the men</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                           Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>She's playing her game and you can hear them say</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                         Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>She is looking good, for beauty we will pay</p>

<p class=Chords>Am                           Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>She's posing for consumer products now and then</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                          Em                    Am       Em</p>
<p>For every camera she gives the best she can</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                    Em              Am       Em</p>
<p>I saw her on the cover of a magazine</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                           Em              Am       Em</p>
