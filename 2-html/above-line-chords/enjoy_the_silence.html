<h3>Intro</h3>
<p class=Chords>Bm    D    x 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Bm           Dm</p>
<p>Words of violence, break the silence</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>Come crashing in, into my little world</p>
<p class=Chords>Bm           Dm</p>
<p>Painful to me, pierce right through me</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>Can't you understand oh my little girl</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Em           G             Bm           D</p>
<p>All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here, in my arms</p>
<p class=Chords>Em           G        Bm            Bflat</p>
<p>Words are very unnecessary, they can only do harm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Bm    D    x 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Bm           Dm</p>
<p>Vows are spoken, to be broken</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>Feelings are intense, words are trivial</p>
<p class=Chords>Bm           Dm</p>
<p>Pleasures remain, so does the pain</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>Words are meaningless, and forgettable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Em           G             Bm           D</p>
<p>All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here, in my arms</p>
<p class=Chords>Em           G        Bm            Bflat</p>
<p>Words are very unnecessary, they can only do harm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Em           G             Bm           D... (to fade)</p>
<h5>(It's easier to play Em with just three fingers, leaving the top string
open. And you play Bm and Bb with a barre so it's just a simple slide down from
2nd to 1st frets and lift your second finger off.)</h5>
