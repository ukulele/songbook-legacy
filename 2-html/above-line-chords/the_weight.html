<p>I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead</p>
<p class=Chords>G                Bm                      C                G</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a
bed?&quot;</p>

<p>He just grinned and shook my hand, and &quot;No!&quot;, was
all he said.</p>
