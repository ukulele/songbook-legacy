<p>Oh is this the way they say the future's meant to feel?</p>
<p class=Chords>      G</p>
<p>Or just twenty thousand people standing in a field?</p>
<p class=Chords>      C</p>
<p>And I just don't understand quite what this feeling is</p>
<p class=Chords>      G</p>
<p>That's okay cos we're all sorted out for E's and Whizz</p>
<p class=Chords>      C</p>
<p>And tell me when the spaceship lands</p>
<p class=Chords>                                G</p>
<p>Cos all this has just got to mean something</p>

<p class=Chords>F      G           Bflat</p>
<p>It feels alright but then tomorrow morning</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                   Bflat      G      G</p>
<p>Ohh ohh when you come down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>           C</p>
<p>Oh yeah the pirate radio told us what was going down</p>
<p class=Chords>      G</p>
<p>Got the tickets from some fucked up bloke in Camden Town</p>
<p class=Chords>      C</p>
<p>And no one seems to know exactly where it is</p>
<p class=Chords>      G</p>
<p>But that's okay, cos we're all sorted out for E's and Whizz</p>
<p class=Chords>      C                                      G</p>
<p>At four o'clock the normal world seems very very very far
away</p>
<p>Hey hey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Chords>Dm</p>
<p>In the middle of the night</p>
<p class=Chords>F      G           Bflat</p>
<p>It feels alright but then tomorrow morning</p>
<p class=Chords>Am                   Bflat      G      G</p>
<p>Ohh ohh when you come down</p>

<p class=Chords>C</p>
<p>Everybody asks your name they say we're all the same and now
it's,</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>Nice One, Geezer - that's as far as the conversation went</p>
<p class=Chords>C</p>
<p>I lost my friends I dance alone, it's 6 o'clock, I wanna go
home</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>But it's no way not today, makes you wonder what it meant</p>
<p class=Chords>C</p>
<p>And this hollow feeling grows and grows and grows and grows</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>And you wanna call your mother and say, &quot;Mother,</p>
<p>I can never come home again</p>
<p class=Chords>C</p>
<p>because I seem to have left an important part of my brain</p>
<p class=Chords>G</p>
<p>somewhere in a field in Hampshire. Alright</p>
