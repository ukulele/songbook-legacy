<p>It's [B] just gone noon, half [Am] past monsoon</p>
<p>On the [B] banks of the river [Am] Nile</p>
<p>Here [B] comes the boat [Am] only half afloat</p>
<p>Oarsman [B] grins a toothless [Am] smile</p>
<p>Only [B] just one more to this [Am] desolate shore</p>
<p>Last [B] boat along the river [Am] Nile</p>
<p>Doesn't [B] seem to care, no more [Am] wind in his hair</p>
<p>As he [B] reaches the last half [Am] mile</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oar [Em] snaps in his hand as he [Gm] reaches dry land</p>
<p>But the [Em] sound doesn't deafen his [C7] smile</p>
<p>Just [Em] pokes at wet sand with an [Gm] oar in his hand</p>
<p>Floats [Em] off down the river [D] Nile</p>
<p>Floats off down the ri- [Db] -ver [B] Nile</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All aboard...</p>

<h5>(Db and C# are the same chord. Use a 3-string index finger barre to shift
between Em and Gm)</h5>
<h5>(We can use kazoos to play all the saxophone bits. Go on. Let's go crazy.)</h5>
