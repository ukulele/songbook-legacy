<p class=Chords>Em                                B</p>
<p>I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window</p>
<p class=Chords>Em                            B</p>
<p>I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind</p>
<p class=Chords>E  E7       Am</p>
<p>She was my woman</p>
<p class=Chords>Em                  B                               
Em          D</p>
<p>As she deceived me I watched, and went out of my mind</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>G         D</p>
<p>My, my, my, Delilah</p>
<p class=Chords>D           G</p>
<p>Why, why, why, Delilah</p>
<p class=Chords>G     G7          C              Am</p>
<p>I could see that girl was no good for me</p>
<p class=Chords>G                            D                     
G                   B</p>
<p>But I was lost like a slave that no man could free</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>Em                                B</p>
<p>At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting</p>
<p class=Chords>Em                                B</p>
<p>I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door</p>
<p class=Chords>E  E7          Am</p>
<p>She stood there laughing</p>
<p class=Chords>Em                  B                              Em         
D</p>
<p>I felt the knife in my hand, and she laughed no more</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>G         D</p>
<p>My, my, my, Delilah</p>
<p class=Chords>D           G</p>
<p>Why, why, why, Delilah</p>
<p class=Chords>G     G7          C              Am</p>
<p>So before they come to break down the door</p>
<p class=Chords>G                            D                      G      B</p>
<p>Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more</p>
