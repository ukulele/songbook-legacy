<p class=Chords>C                                                        Dm</p>
<p>Well sometimes I go out by myself, and I look across the
water</p>
<p class=Chords>              C                                                       
Dm</p>
<p>And I think of all the things, what you do, and in my head I
make a picture</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p class=Chords>F                                        Em</p>
<p>Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess</p>
<p class=Chords>              F                                Em</p>
<p>And I've missed your ginger hair, and the way you like to
dress</p>
<p class=Chords>F                                    
C                                      G</p>
<p>Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me</p>
<p class=Chords>                                            C        Dm</p>
<p>Why won't you come on over Valerie? Valerie</p>
<p class=Chords>                             C        Dm</p>
<p>              Valerie,       Valerie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>C</p>
<p>Did you have to go to jail, put your house up on for sale</p>
<p class=Chords>                Dm</p>
<p>Did you get a good lawyer?</p>
<p class=Chords>            C</p>
<p>I hope you didn't catch a tan,</p>
<p class=Chords>                                           Dm</p>
<p>I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya</p>
<p class=Chords>                    C                                          
Dm</p>
<p>And are you shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of you
hair, are you busy?</p>
<p class=Chords>                 C                                                       
Dm</p>
<p>And did you have to pay the fine you were dodging all the
time are you still dizzy?</p>
