<p>I live in an apartment on the ninety-ninth floor of my block</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F                G               
F        C F G F</p>
<p>And I sit at home looking out the window imagining the world
has stopped</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F        G                F        C F G

<p>Then in flies a guy who's all dressed up like a Union Jack</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F                G        F        C F G
F</p>
<p>And says, I've won five pounds if I have his kind of
detergent pack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said,</p>
<p class=Chords>C        Em              F        G</p>
<p>Hey!  You! Get off of my cloud (3x)</p>
<p class=Chords>Bflat                        G</p>
<p>Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud,
baby         [C] [F] [G] [F]</p>

F                C F G F</p>
<p>The telephone is ringing, I say, &quot;Hi, it's me, who is
it there on the line?&quot;</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F                G               
F        C F G F</p>
<p>A voice says, &quot;Hi, hello, how are you,&quot; &quot;Well,
I guess I'm doin' fine&quot;</p>
<p class=Chords>C                              F               
G                F        C F G F</p>
<p>He says, &quot;It's three a.m., there's too much noise,
don't you people ever wanna go to bed?</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F                G                F       
C F G F</p>
<p>Just 'cause you feel so good, do you have to drive me out of
my head?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said,</p>
<p class=Chords>C        Em              F        G</p>
<p>Hey!  You! Get off of my cloud (3x)</p>
<p class=Chords>Bflat                        G</p>

G                        F        C F G F</p>
<p>I was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a
drive downtown</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F               
G                        F        C F G F</p>
<p>It was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a
soul around</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F               
G                        F          C F G F</p>
<p>I laid myself out, I was so tired and I started to dream</p>
<p class=Chords>C                      F                G

<p>In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag
stuck on my windscreen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said,</p>
<p class=Chords>C        Em              F        G</p>
<p>Hey!  You! Get off of my cloud (3x)</p>

<p>Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd</p>
