<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=Chords>C           G      C           G           F</p>
<p>I've been cheated by you since I      don't know      when.</p>
<p class=Chords> C      G           C           G           F</p>
<p> So I      made up my      mind it must      come to an     
end.</p>
<p class=Chords> C                Caug</p>
<p> Look      at me now,       will I ever learn?</p>
<p class=Chords> C           Caug                F</p>
<p> I don't know        how but I suddenly      lose control.</p>
<p class=Chords>            G</p>
<p>There's a fire      within my soul.</p>
<p class=Chords> F      C      G</p>
<p>Just      one      look and I can hear a bell ring,</p>
<p class=Chords>F      C      G</p>
<p>One      more      look and I forget everything, oooh.</p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p class=Chords>C</p>
<p>Mamma mia, here I go again.</p>
<p class=Chords>Bb      F                C</p>
<p>My      my,   how can I      resist you?</p>
<p class=Chords>C</p>
<p>Mamma mia, does it show again?</p>
<p class=Chords>Bb      F                      C</p>
<p>My      my, just how much I've missed you.</p>
<p class=Chords>C                G</p>
<p>Yes, I've been      brokenhearted.</p>
<p class=Chords>Am            Em</p>
<p>Blue since the day we parted.</p>
<p class=Chords>Bb      F      Dm           G</p>
<p>Why      why      did I ever   let you go.</p>
<p class=Chords>C           Am</p>
<p>Mamma mia,        now I really know,</p>
<p class=Chords>Bb      F      Dm           G      C  C+  C  C+</p>
<p>My      my,      I could never let you go.</p>

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p class=Chords>C        G        C              G             F</p>
<p>I've been angry and sad about the things that you do.</p>
<p class=Chords>C        G          C            G             F</p>
<p>I can't count all the times that I've told you we're
through.</p>
<p class=Chords>C             Caug</p>
<p>And when you go, when you slam the door,</p>
<p class=Chords>C          Caug                 F</p>
<p>I think you know that you won't be away too long,</p>
<p class=Chords>                  G</p>
<p>You know that I'm not that strong.</p>
<p class=Chords>F      C      G</p>
<p>Just      one      look and I can hear a bell ring,</p>
<p class=Chords>F      C      G</p>
<p>One      more      look and I forget everything, oooh.</p>
