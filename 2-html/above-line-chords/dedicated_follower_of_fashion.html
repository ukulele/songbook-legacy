<p class=Chords>                   G                      C</p>

<p class=Chords>                   G                  C</p>
<p>his clothes are loud, but never square.</p>
<p class=Chords>F                                 C                A7</p>
<p>It will make or break him, so he's got to buy the best,</p>

<p>And when he does his little rounds,</p>
<p class=Chords>                    G                C</p>
<p>round the boutiques of London Town,</p>
<p class=Chords>F                          C            A7</p>
<p>eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends,</p>

<p>Oh, yes, he is (Oh, yes, he is)</p>
<p class=Chords>        C</p>
<p>Oh, yes, he is (Oh, yes, he is)</p>
<p class=Chords>          F                        C</p>
<p>He thinks he is a flower to be looked at,</p>
<p class=Chords>          F                            C                A7</p>
<p>and when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,</p>
<p class=Chords>         Dm        G7          C</p>
<p>he feels a dedicated follower of fashion.</p>

<p class=Chords>            F                                    C</p>
<p>There's one thing that he loves, and that is flattery,</p>
<p class=Chords>          F                            C                A7</p>
<p>one week he's in polka dots, the next week he's in stripes,</p>

<p class=Chords>                   G                  C</p>
<p>in Regent Street and Leicester Square.</p>
<p class=Chords>F                              C        A7</p>
<p>Ev'rywhere the carnabetian army marches on,</p>
<p class=Chords>          Dm          G7            C</p>
<p>each one a dedicated follower of fashion.</p>

<p class=Chords>          F                                    C</p>
<p>His world is built 'round discotheques and parties</p>
<p class=Chords>          F                            C                    A7</p>
<p>this pleasure seeking individual always looks his best,</p>

<p class=Chords>          F                                C</p>
<p>He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly,</p>
<p class=Chords>        F                          C              A7</p>
<p>in matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be,</p>
<p class=Chords>          Dm          G7                 C       A7</p>
<p>'cos he's a dedicated follower of fashion,</p>
