<p>When he went away the blues walked in and met me.</p>
<p class=Chords>Am              D7                 G                  Em</p>

<p class=Chords>Am       D7          G                     E7</p>

<h5>(Bm7-5 is played almost exactly like Dm7 but with the little finger tucked
underneath the others on the second fret instead of third.)</h5>
<h6>(Billie Holiday sang this. She died with $0.70 in her bank account. I think
the two facts are unrelated.)</h6>
