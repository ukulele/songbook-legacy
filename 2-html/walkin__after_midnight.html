<h1>Walkin' After Midnight</h1>
<h2>(Patsy Cline)</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>I go out [C] walking after [C7] midnight,</p>
<p>Out in the [F] moonlight just [Dm] like we used to [G7] do,</p>
<p>I'm always [C] walking after [F] midnight [G7] searching for
[C] you. [G7]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p>I walk for [C] miles along the [C7] highway,</p>
<p>Well that's just [F] my way of [Dm] saying I love [G7] you,</p>
<p>I'm always [C] walking after [F] midnight [G7] searching for
[C] you. [C7]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>I stopped to [F] see a weeping willow,</p>
<p>Crying on his pillow, [C] maybe he's crying for me.</p>
<p>And [F] as the skies turn gloomy,</p>
<p>Night winds whisper to me, I'm [C] lonesome as I can [G7]
be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<p>I go out [C] walking after [C7] midnight,</p>
<p>Out in the [F] starlight, just [Dm] hoping may [G7] be,</p>
<p>Somewhere you're [C] walking after [F] midnight [G7]
searching for [C] me.</p>
