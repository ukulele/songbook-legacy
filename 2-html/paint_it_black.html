<h1>Paint it Black</h1>
<h2>(The Rolling Stones)</h2>
<p>[Dm] I see a red door and I [A7sus4] want it painted [A7]
black</p>
<p>[Dm] No colours anymore I [A7sus4] want them to turn [A7]
black</p>
<p>[Dm] I [C] see the [F] girls walk [C] by dressed [Dm] in
their summer clothes</p>
<p>I [C] have to [F] turn my [C] head un- [G] -til my darkness
[A7] goes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Dm] I see a line of cars and [A7sus4] they're all painted
[A7] black</p>
<p>[Dm] With flowers and my love both [A7sus4] never to come
[A7] back</p>
<p>[Dm] I [C] see people [F] turn their [C] heads and [Dm] quickly
look away</p>
<p>Like a [C] new born [F] baby [C] it just [G] happens every
[A7] day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Dm] I look inside myself and [A7sus4] see my heart is [A7]
black</p>
<p>[Dm] I see my red door and must [A7sus4] have it painted
[A7] black</p>
<p>[Dm] Maybe [C] then I'll [F] fade away [C] and [Dm] not have
to face the facts</p>
<p>It's not [C] easy [F] facing [C] up when [G] your whole
world is [A7] black</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Dm] No more will my green sea go [A7sus4] turn a deeper
[A7] blue</p>
<p>[Dm] I could not foresee this thing [A7sus4] happening to
[A7] you</p>
<p>[Dm] If [C] I look [F] hard en- [C] -ough in- [Dm] -to the
setting sun</p>
<p>My [C] love will [F] laugh with [C] me be- [G] fore the
morning [A7] comes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Dm] I see a red door and I [A7sus4] want it painted [A7]
black</p>
<p>[Dm] No colours anymore I [A7sus4] want them to turn [A7]
black</p>
<p>[Dm] I [C] see the [F] girls go [C] by dressed [Dm] in their
summer clothes</p>
<p>I [C] have to [F] turn my [C] head un- [G] -til my darkness
[A7] goes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Dm] [Dm] [A7sus4] [A7] x 2</p>
<p>Hmm, hmm, hmm...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanna see it [Dm] tainted, tainted black</p>
<p>[A7sus4] Black as night, [A7] black as coal</p>
<p>I [Dm] wanna see the sun blotted [A7sus4] out from the sky
[A7]</p>
<p>I wanna see it [Dm] painted, painted, painted, painted
[A7sus4] black [A7]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Dm] [Dm] [A7sus4] [A7] x 2</p>
<p>Hmm, hmm, hmm...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Dm]</p>
