<h1>Hallelujah</h1>
<h2>(Leonard Cohen)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[C]      [Am]           [C]      [Am]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I [C] heard there was a [Am] secret chord</p>
<p>that [C] David played and it [Am] pleased the lord</p>
<p>but [F] you don't really [G] care for music [C] do you [G]</p>
<p>Well it [C] goes like this the [F] fourth, the [G] fifth</p>
<p>the [Am] minor fall and the [F] major lift</p>
<p>the [G] baffled king [E7] composing [Am] hallelujah</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>Halle- [F] -lujah, Halle- [Am] -lujah, Halle- [F] -lujah,
Halle-lu- [C] [G] -ujah</p>
<p>[C]        [Am]              [C]        [Am]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well your [C] faith was strong but you [Am] needed proof</p>
<p>You [C] saw her bathing [Am] on the roof</p>
<p>Her [F] beauty and the [G] moonlight overthrew [C] you [G]</p>
<p>She [C] tied you to her [F] kitchen [G] chair</p>
<p>she [Am] broke your throne and she [F] cut your hair</p>
<p>And [G] from your lips she [E7] drew the [Am] hallelujah</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[C] Baby i've been [Am] here before</p>
<p>I've [C] seen this room and I've [Am] walked this floor</p>
<p>I [F] used to live [G] alone before I [C] knew you [G]</p>
<p>I've [C] seen your flag on the [F] marble [G] arch</p>
<p>But [Am] love is not a [F] victory march</p>
<p>It's a [G] cold and it's a [E7] broken [Am] hallelujah</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well [C] there was a time when you [Am] let me know</p>
<p>What's [C] really going [Am] on below</p>
<p>But [F] now you never [G] show that to me [C] do you [G]</p>
<p>But [C] remember when I [F] moved in [G] you</p>
<p>And the [Am] holy dove was [F] moving too</p>
<p>And [G] every breath we [E7] drew was [Am] hallelujah</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well [C] maybe there's a [Am] god above</p>
<p>But [C] all I've ever [Am] learned from love</p>
<p>Was [F] how to shoot [G] somebody who [C] outdrew you [G]</p>
<p>It's [C] not a cry that you [F] hear at [G] night</p>
<p>It's [Am] not somebody who's [F] seen the light</p>
<p>It's a [G] cold and it's a [E7] broken [Am] hallelujah</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>[F] Hallelujah [Am] Hallelujah [F] Hallelujah, [C] Hallel
[G] ujah [C]</p>
