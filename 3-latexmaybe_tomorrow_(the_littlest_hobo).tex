There's a \upchord{Dm}voice that keeps on calling \upchord{C}me
Down the \upchord{Dm}road is where I'll always \upchord{C}be
Every \upchord{F}stop I make, I'll make a new \upchord{Bb}friend
Can't stay for \upchord{Gm}long, just turn a- \upchord{C}-round
and I'm gone \upchord{F}again
&nbsp;
Maybe to- \upchord{Gm}-morrow, I'll \upchord{Bb}wanna settle \upchord{F}down \upchord{Am]
\upchord{Dm]
Until to \upchord{Bb}morrow, I will \upchord{C}just keep moving \upchord{F}on
&nbsp;
Down this \upchord{Dm}road, that never seems to \upchord{C}end
Where new a- \upchord{Dm}-venture, lies just around the \upchord{C}bend
So if you \upchord{F}wanna join me for a \upchord{Bb}while
Just grab your \upchord{Gm}hat, come travel \upchord{C}light
That's hobo \upchord{F}style
&nbsp;
Maybe to- \upchord{Gm}-morrow, I'll \upchord{Bb}wanna settle \upchord{F}down \upchord{Am]
\upchord{Dm]
Until to \upchord{Bb}morrow, the \upchord{C}whole world is my \upchord{F}home

There's a \upchord{Dm}world, that's waiting to un- \upchord{C}-fold
A brand new \upchord{Dm}tale, no one has ever \upchord{C}told,
We've journey'd \upchord{F}far but, you know it won't be \upchord{Bb}long
We're almost \upchord{Gm}there and we've paid our \upchord{C}fare with the
