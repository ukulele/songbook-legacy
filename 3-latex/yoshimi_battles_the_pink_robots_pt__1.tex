\upchord{C}\upchord{Em}\upchord{Dm}\upchord{F}\upchord{G}

\upchord{C}Her name is Yo- \upchord{Em}-shimi
\upchord{F}She's a black belt in ka- \upchord{G}-rate
\upchord{C}Working for the \upchord{Em}city
\upchord{F}She has to discipline her \upchord{G}body
Cause she \upchord{F}knows that it's de- \upchord{G}-manding
To de- \upchord{C}-feat those \upchord{Em}evil ma- \upchord{F}-chines
I know she can \upchord{G}beat them


\textbf{Chorus}
Oh Yo- \upchord{C}-shimi, they don't be- \upchord{Em}-lieve me
But \upchord{Dm}you won't let those \upchord{F}robots de- \upchord{G}-feat me
Yo- \upchord{C}-shimi, they don't be- \upchord{Em}-lieve me
But \upchord{Dm}you won't let those \upchord{F}robots \upchord{G}eat me


\upchord{C}Those evil natured \upchord{Em}robots
\upchord{F}They're programmed to de- \upchord{G}-stroy us
\upchord{C}She's gotta be strong to \upchord{Em}fight them
\upchord{F}So she's taking lots of \upchord{G}vitamins
Cause she \upchord{F}knows that it'd be \upchord{G}tragic
If those \upchord{C}evil \upchord{Em}robots \upchord{F}win
I know she can \upchord{G}beat them

\textbf{Chorus}
Oh Yo- \upchord{C}-shimi, they don't be- \upchord{Em}-lieve me
But \upchord{Dm}you won't let those \upchord{F}robots de- \upchord{G}-feat me
Yo- \upchord{C}-shimi, they don't be- \upchord{Em}-lieve me
But \upchord{Dm}you won't let those \upchord{F}robots \upchord{G}eat me

\upchord{C}\upchord{Em}\upchord{Dm}\upchord{F}\upchord{G}

\textbf{Chorus}
Oh Yo- \upchord{C}-shimi, they don't be- \upchord{Em}-lieve me
But \upchord{Dm}you won't let those \upchord{F}robots de- \upchord{G}-feat me
Yo- \upchord{C}-shimi, they don't be- \upchord{Em}-lieve me
But \upchord{Dm}you won't let those \upchord{F}robots \upchord{G}eat me

\upchord{C}\upchord{Em}\upchord{Dm}\upchord{F}\upchord{G}
\upchord{C}\upchord{Em}\upchord{Dm}\upchord{F}\upchord{G}\upchord{C}
