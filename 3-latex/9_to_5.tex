\section{9 to 5 / (Dolly Parton)}\label{sec:9_to_5}
\upchord{F$\sharp\}Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
\upchord{B}Pour myself a cup of ambition
\upchord{F$\sharp\}Yawnin' and stretchin' and tryin' to come to \upchord{C$\sharp\7}Life
\upchord{F$\sharp\}Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
\upchord{B}Out on the streets the traffic starts jumpin'
\upchord{F$\sharp\}With folks like me on the \upchord{C$\sharp\}job from 9 to \upchord{F$\sharp\}5

Workin' \upchord{B}9 to 5 What a way to make a livin'
Barely \upchord{F$\sharp\}gettin' by, it's all takin' And no givin'
They just \upchord{B}use your mind and they never give you credit
It's en- \upchord{G$\sharp\}-ough to drive you \upchord{C$\sharp\}Crazy if you let it

\upchord{B}9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would \upchord{F$\sharp\}think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to \upchord{B}move ahead But the boss won't seem to let me
I \upchord{G$\sharp\}swear sometimes that \upchord{C$\sharp\}man is out to get me

\upchord{F$\sharp\}They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
\upchord{B}You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But \upchord{F$\sharp\}you got dream he'll never take a- \upchord{C$\sharp\7}-way
\upchord{F$\sharp\}In the same boat with a lot of your friends
\upchord{B}Waitin' for the day your ship 'll  come in
\upchord{F$\sharp\}And the tide's gonna turn an' it's \upchord{C$\sharp\}all gonna roll
you a- \upchord{F$\sharp\}-way

Workin' \upchord{B}9 to 5 What a way to make a livin'
Barely \upchord{F$\sharp\}gettin' by, it's all takin' And no givin'
They just \upchord{B}use your mind and they never give you credit
It's en- \upchord{G$\sharp\}-ough to drive you \upchord{C$\sharp\}Crazy if you let it

\upchord{B}9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a \upchord{F$\sharp\}better life and you think about it don't you
It's a \upchord{B}rich man's game, no matter what they call it
And you \upchord{G$\sharp\}spend your life putting \upchord{C$\sharp\}money in his
wallet
