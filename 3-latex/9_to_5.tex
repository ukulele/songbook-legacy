\upchord{F#}Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
\upchord{B}Pour myself a cup of ambition
\upchord{F#}Yawnin' and stretchin' and tryin' to come to \upchord{C#7}Life
\upchord{F#}Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
\upchord{B}Out on the streets the traffic starts jumpin'
\upchord{F#}With folks like me on the \upchord{C#}job from 9 to \upchord{F#}5
\\
Workin' \upchord{B}9 to 5 What a way to make a livin'
Barely \upchord{F#}gettin' by, it's all takin' And no givin'
They just \upchord{B}use your mind and they never give you credit
It's en- \upchord{G#}-ough to drive you \upchord{C#}Crazy if you let it
\\
\upchord{B}9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would \upchord{F#}think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to \upchord{B}move ahead But the boss won't seem to let me
I \upchord{G#}swear sometimes that \upchord{C#}man is out to get me
\\
\upchord{F#}They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
\upchord{B}You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But \upchord{F#}you got dream he'll never take a- \upchord{C#7}-way
\upchord{F#}In the same boat with a lot of your friends
\upchord{B}Waitin' for the day your ship 'll  come in
\upchord{F#}And the tide's gonna turn an' it's \upchord{C#}all gonna roll
you a- \upchord{F#}-way

They just \upchord{B}use your mind and they never give you credit
It's en- \upchord{G#}-ough to drive you \upchord{C#}Crazy if you let it
\\
\upchord{B}9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a \upchord{F#}better life and you think about it don't you
It's a \upchord{B}rich man's game, no matter what they call it
And you \upchord{G#}spend your life putting \upchord{C#}money in his
wallet
