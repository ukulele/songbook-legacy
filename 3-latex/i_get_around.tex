{\small (While there are loads of chords in this one, remember that it's just a key
change. In the middle everything goes up one semi-tone and then repeats so
you're really just playing the same thing again, one fret higher. Not that this
necessarily makes it easier...)}
{\tiny (If anyone ever tells you Pet Sounds is the best Beach Boys album tell them
to listen more closely to Surf's Up)</h6>
