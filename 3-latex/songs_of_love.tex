\section{Songs of Love / (Divine Comedy)}\label{sec:songs_of_love}
\upchord{C}Pale pubescent \upchord{F}beasts
roam through the \upchord{G}streets and coffee \upchord{Am}shops
Their \upchord{Dm}prey gather in \upchord{F}herds
with stiff knee length \upchord{Eb}skirts and white ankle \upchord{C$\sharp\9}
socks
But \upchord{C}while they search for a \upchord{F}mate
my type hiber- \upchord{G}-nates in bedrooms a- \upchord{Am}-bove
Com- \upchord{D7}-posing their \upchord{F}songs \upchord{G}of \upchord{C}love

\upchord{C}Young, uniform \upchord{F}minds
in uniform \upchord{G}lines and uniform \upchord{Am}ties
Run \upchord{Dm}round with trousers on \upchord{F}fire
and signs of de- \upchord{Eb}-sire they cannot dis- \upchord{C$\sharp\9}-guise
While \upchord{C}I try to find \upchord{F}words
as light as the \upchord{G}birds that circle a- \upchord{Am}-bove
To \upchord{D7}put in my \upchord{F}songs \upchord{G}of \upchord{C}love

\upchord{Ab}Fate doesn't \upchord{Bb9}hang on a \upchord{C}wrong or right \upchord{Am}
choice
\upchord{Ab}Fortune de- \upchord{Bb9}-pends on the \upchord{C}tone of your \upchord{G}
voice

So \upchord{C}sing while you have \upchord{F}time
Let the sun \upchord{G}shine down from \upchord{Am}above
And \upchord{D7}fill you with \upchord{F}songs \upchord{G}of \upchord{C}love

voice

So let's \upchord{C}sing while we still \upchord{F}can
While the sun \upchord{G}hangs high up a- \upchord{Am}-bove
\upchord{D7}Wonderful \upchord{F}songs \upchord{G}of \upchord{Am}love \upchord{Am7}
\upchord{D7}Beautiful \upchord{F}songs \upchord{G}of \upchord{C}love
{\small (Intro riff can be played by adding 1st finger to the 1st fret of 2nd
string to create Csus4 and alternating it with C.)}
{\small (F can be replaced with F+9 – just remove yr 2nd finger from top string
&amp; play it as a one finger chord.)}
{\small (Some new chords here such as C$\sharp\9 and Bb9. Play them using barres. Best way
to play Eb here though is without a barre, leaving the top string open)</h5>
