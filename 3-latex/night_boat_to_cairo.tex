\upchord{Em}     \upchord{Gm}     \upchord{Em}          \upchord{D}     \upchord{Db}     \upchord{B}


It's \upchord{B}just gone noon, half \upchord{Am}past monsoon
On the \upchord{B}banks of the river \upchord{Am}Nile
Here \upchord{B}comes the boat \upchord{Am}only half afloat
Oarsman \upchord{B}grins a toothless \upchord{Am}smile
Only \upchord{B}just one more to this \upchord{Am}desolate shore
Last \upchord{B}boat along the river \upchord{Am}Nile
Doesn't \upchord{B}seem to care, no more \upchord{Am}wind in his hair
As he \upchord{B}reaches the last half \upchord{Am}mile

The oar \upchord{Em}snaps in his hand as he \upchord{Gm}reaches dry land
But the \upchord{Em}sound doesn't deafen his \upchord{C7}smile
Just \upchord{Em}pokes at wet sand with an \upchord{Gm}oar in his hand
Floats \upchord{Em}off down the river \upchord{D}Nile
Floats off down the ri- \upchord{Db}-ver \upchord{B}Nile

All aboard...

"Night Boat to Cairo!.."
{\small (Db and C$\sharp\ are the same chord. Use a 3-string index finger barre to shift
between Em and Gm)}
{\small (We can use kazoos to play all the saxophone bits. Go on. Let's go crazy.)}
