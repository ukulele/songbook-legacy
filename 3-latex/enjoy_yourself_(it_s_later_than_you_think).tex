\section{Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think) / (Carl Sigman / Herb Magidson)}\label{sec:enjoy_yourself_(it_s_later_than_you_think)}

\textbf{Chorus}
\upchord{C}Enjoy yourself, it's later than you \upchord{G7}think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the \upchord{C}pink
The years go by, as quickly as you \upchord{F}wink
Enjoy yourself, \upchord{C}enjoy yourself,
It's \upchord{G7}later than you \upchord{C}think

\textbf{Verse 1:}
(BRIEF PAUSE, NO STRUMMING)
"Hello, I'm __________
And I'm going to enjoy myself first..."

It's \upchord{C}good to be wise when you're young
'Cos you can \upchord{G7}only be young but the \upchord{C}once
Enjoy yourself and have lots of \upchord{F}fun
So \upchord{C}glad and live life \upchord{G7}longer than you've ever \upchord{C}
done

\textbf{Chorus}

\textbf{Verse 2:}
Get \upchord{C}wisdom, get knowledge and understanding
These \upchord{G7}three, were given free by the \upchord{C}maker
Go to school, learn the rules, don't be no \upchord{F}faker
It's not \upchord{C}wise for you to \upchord{G7}be a foot \upchord{C}stool

\textbf{Chorus}

\upchord{C}...      \upchord{D}...

\textbf{Chorus (key change):}
\upchord{D}Enjoy yourself, it's later than you \upchord{A7}think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the \upchord{D}pink
The years go by, as quickly as you \upchord{G}wink
Enjoy yourself, \upchord{D}enjoy yourself,
<p>It's [A7] later than you [D] think</p>
