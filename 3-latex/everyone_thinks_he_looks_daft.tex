\section{Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft / (The Wedding Present)}\label{sec:everyone_thinks_he_looks_daft}
Oh why do \upchord{D}you catch my \upchord{A}eye, then turn a- \upchord{D}-way?
\upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
I thought we \upchord{D}said all the \upchord{A}things we had to \upchord{D}say
\upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
Shaun said he \upchord{D}saw you holding \upchord{A}hands with your new
\upchord{D}friend \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
How does it \upchord{D}feel to \upchord{A}know you've just won a- \upchord{D}
-gain? \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}

\textbf{Chorus}
Don't give me \upchord{D}that! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Because you were \upchord{D}seen! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Every- \upchord{D}-one thinks he looks \upchord{A}daft but you can \upchord{G}
have your \upchord{D}dream \upchord{A}\upchord{G}

\upchord{D}\upchord{D}\upchord{A}\upchord{A}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}(x2)

Can I keep that \upchord{D}book of \upchord{A}yours and maybe this one \upchord{D}
too? \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
Oh sure, I'll \upchord{D}bring them round to- \upchord{A}-morrow if that
will \upchord{D}do \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
Was it really \upchord{D}full? They must have \upchord{A}queued there
since half past \upchord{D}three \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
Oh I didn't \upchord{D}go, was it a \upchord{A}good film? Well that's just
\upchord{D}me! \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}

\textbf{Chorus}
Don't give me \upchord{D}that! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Because you were \upchord{D}seen! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Every- \upchord{D}-one thinks he looks \upchord{A}daft but you can \upchord{G}
have your \upchord{D}dream \upchord{A}\upchord{G}

\upchord{E}\upchord{D}\upchord{A}\upchord{A}x 8

\upchord{D}\upchord{D}\upchord{A}\upchord{A}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}(x2)

Guess who I \upchord{D}saw by your old \upchord{A}house just the other \upchord{D}
day \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
That kid we \upchord{D}used to think was \upchord{A}mad, but now he looks
\upchord{D}okay \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
I think someone's \upchord{D}here, look out the \upchord{A}window
I can't make out \upchord{D}who \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}
Oh I'd love to stay \upchord{D}but I've \upchord{A}really got so many
things to \upchord{D}do \upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{G}

\textbf{Chorus}
Don't give me \upchord{D}that! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Because you were \upchord{D}seen! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Every- \upchord{D}-one thinks he looks \upchord{A}daft but you can \upchord{G}
have your \upchord{D}dream \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Don't give me \upchord{D}that! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Because you were \upchord{D}seen! \upchord{A}\upchord{G}
Every- \upchord{D}-one thinks he looks \upchord{A}daft but you can \upchord{G}
have your \upchord{D}dream \upchord{A}\upchord{G}

{\small (As with many of our songs, this one can be made easier by simply playing
an index finger barre version of D and E)}
{\tiny (This is from the brilliant album "George Best". Distinctive
pauses in the instrumental middle bit, listen to the recorded version to
practise them)</h6>
