\section{Dirty Old Town / (Ewan MacColl)}\label{sec:dirty_old_town}
\textbf{Intro}
\upchord{D}\upchord{G}\upchord{D}\upchord{Em7}\upchord{Bm}

I met my \upchord{G}love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a \upchord{C}dream by the old ca- \upchord{G}-nal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old \upchord{D}town dirty old \upchord{Em7}town

Clouds are \upchord{G}drifting across the moon
Cats are \upchord{C}prowling on their \upchord{G}beat
Spring's a girl from the streets at night
Dirty old \upchord{D}town dirty old \upchord{Em7}town

\textbf{Instrumental}
\upchord{C}\upchord{F}\upchord{C}\upchord{G}\upchord{Am}

I heard a \upchord{G}siren from the docks
Saw a \upchord{C}train set the night on \upchord{G}fire
I smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old \upchord{D}town dirty old \upchord{Em7}town

I'm gonna \upchord{G}make me a big sharp axe
Shining \upchord{C}steel tempered in the \upchord{G}fire
I'll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old \upchord{D}town dirty old \upchord{Em7}town

I met my \upchord{G}love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a \upchord{C}dream by the old ca- \upchord{G}-nal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old \upchord{Am}town..........dirty old \upchord{Em7}town
Dirty old \upchord{D}town dirty old \upchord{Em7}town
