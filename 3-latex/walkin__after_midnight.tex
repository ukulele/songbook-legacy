\section{Walkin' After Midnight / (Patsy Cline)}\label{sec:walkin__after_midnight}
\textbf{Verse 1}
I go out \upchord{C}walking after \upchord{C7}midnight,
Out in the \upchord{F}moonlight just \upchord{Dm}like we used to \upchord{G7}do,
I'm always \upchord{C}walking after \upchord{F}midnight \upchord{G7}searching for
\upchord{C}you. \upchord{G7]
\\
\textbf{Verse 2}
I walk for \upchord{C}miles along the \upchord{C7}highway,
Well that's just \upchord{F}my way of \upchord{Dm}saying I love \upchord{G7}you,
I'm always \upchord{C}walking after \upchord{F}midnight \upchord{G7}searching for
\upchord{C}you. \upchord{C7]
\\
\textbf{Chorus}
I stopped to \upchord{F}see a weeping willow,
Crying on his pillow, \upchord{C}maybe he's crying for me.
And \upchord{F}as the skies turn gloomy,
Night winds whisper to me, I'm \upchord{C}lonesome as I can \upchord{G7]
be.
\\
\textbf{Verse 3}
I go out \upchord{C}walking after \upchord{C7}midnight,
Out in the \upchord{F}starlight, just \upchord{Dm}hoping may \upchord{G7}be,
Somewhere you're \upchord{C}walking after \upchord{F}midnight \upchord{G7]
searching for \upchord{C}me.
\textbf{RepeatChorus}
\textbf{Repeat Verse 3}
