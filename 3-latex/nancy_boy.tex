\section{Nancy Boy / (Placebo)}\label{sec:nancy_boy}

\textbf{Intro}
\upchord{G}/ \upchord{G7}, \upchord{G}

\upchord{G}Alcoholic kind of mood
Lose my clothes, lose my \upchord{C}lube
Cruising for a piece of fun
Looking out for number \upchord{G}one
Different partner every night
So narcotic outta \upchord{C}sight
What a gas, what a beautiful ass.

\textbf{Chorus}
And it \upchord{G}all breaks down at the role reversal,
Got the \upchord{D}muse in my head shes universal,
\upchord{C$\sharp\}Spinnin me round shes coming over me \upchord{C}
And it \upchord{G}all breaks down at the first rehearsal,
Got the \upchord{D}muse in my head shes universal,
\upchord{C$\sharp\}Spinnin me round shes coming over me \upchord{C}

\upchord{G}Kind of buzz that lasts for days
Had some help from insect \upchord{C}ways
Comes across all shy and coy
Just another nancy \upchord{G}boy.
Woman man or modern monkey
Just another happy \upchord{C}junkie
Fifty pounds, press my button
Going down.

\textbf{Chorus}

\upchord{G}Does his makeup in his room
Douse himself with cheap \upchord{C}perfume
Eyeholes in a paper bag
Greatest lay I ever \upchord{G}had
Kind of guy who mates for life
Gotta help him find a \upchord{C}wife
Were a couple, when our bodies double.

\textbf{Chorus}
