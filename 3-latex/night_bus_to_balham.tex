\upchord{Em}     \upchord{Gm}     \upchord{Em}          \upchord{D}     \upchord{Db}     \upchord{B}


Just \upchord{B}left the pub, half \upchord{Am}past midnight
On the \upchord{B}banks of the river \upchord{Am}Thames
It was \upchord{B}quite a night, don't \upchord{Am}feel too bright
You \upchord{B}were meant to be home by \upchord{Am}ten
There's \upchord{B}just one bus from Tra- \upchord{Am}-falgar Square
Last \upchord{B}bus across the river \upchord{Am}Thames
There's a \upchord{B}bloke over there with \upchord{Am}sick in his hair
And he \upchord{B}wants to be your \upchord{Am}friend

Only \upchord{Em}half alive as the \upchord{Gm}cold takes hold
You swear you'll \upchord{Em}never do this a- \upchord{C7}-gain
Then the \upchord{Em}155 rolls into \upchord{Gm}view
And you \upchord{Em}float across the river \upchord{D}Thames
Float across the ri- \upchord{Db}-ver \upchord{B}Thames

All aboard...
\upchord{B}     \upchord{Am}          \upchord{B}     \upchord{Am}
