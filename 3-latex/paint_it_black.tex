\upchord{Dm}I see a red door and I \upchord{A7sus4}want it painted \upchord{A7}
black
\upchord{Dm}No colours anymore I \upchord{A7sus4}want them to turn \upchord{A7}
black
\upchord{Dm}I \upchord{C}see the \upchord{F}girls walk \upchord{C}by dressed \upchord{Dm}in
their summer clothes
I \upchord{C}have to \upchord{F}turn my \upchord{C}head un- \upchord{G}-til my darkness
\upchord{A7}goes

\upchord{Dm}I see a line of cars and \upchord{A7sus4}they're all painted
\upchord{A7}black
\upchord{Dm}With flowers and my love both \upchord{A7sus4}never to come
\upchord{A7}back
\upchord{Dm}I \upchord{C}see people \upchord{F}turn their \upchord{C}heads and \upchord{Dm}quickly
look away
Like a \upchord{C}new born \upchord{F}baby \upchord{C}it just \upchord{G}happens every
\upchord{A7}day

\upchord{Dm}I look inside myself and \upchord{A7sus4}see my heart is \upchord{A7}
black
\upchord{Dm}I see my red door and must \upchord{A7sus4}have it painted
\upchord{A7}black
\upchord{Dm}Maybe \upchord{C}then I'll \upchord{F}fade away \upchord{C}and \upchord{Dm}not have
to face the facts
It's not \upchord{C}easy \upchord{F}facing \upchord{C}up when \upchord{G}your whole
world is \upchord{A7}black

\upchord{Dm}No more will my green sea go \upchord{A7sus4}turn a deeper
\upchord{A7}blue
\upchord{Dm}I could not foresee this thing \upchord{A7sus4}happening to
\upchord{A7}you
\upchord{Dm}If \upchord{C}I look \upchord{F}hard en- \upchord{C}-ough in- \upchord{Dm}-to the
setting sun
My \upchord{C}love will \upchord{F}laugh with \upchord{C}me be- \upchord{G}fore the
morning \upchord{A7}comes

\upchord{Dm}I see a red door and I \upchord{A7sus4}want it painted \upchord{A7}
black
\upchord{Dm}No colours anymore I \upchord{A7sus4}want them to turn \upchord{A7}
black
\upchord{Dm}I \upchord{C}see the \upchord{F}girls go \upchord{C}by dressed \upchord{Dm}in their
summer clothes
I \upchord{C}have to \upchord{F}turn my \upchord{C}head un- \upchord{G}-til my darkness
\upchord{A7}goes

\upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm}\upchord{A7sus4}\upchord{A7}x 2
Hmm, hmm, hmm...

I wanna see it \upchord{Dm}tainted, tainted black
\upchord{A7sus4}Black as night, \upchord{A7}black as coal
I \upchord{Dm}wanna see the sun blotted \upchord{A7sus4}out from the sky
\upchord{A7}
I wanna see it \upchord{Dm}painted, painted, painted, painted
\upchord{A7sus4}black \upchord{A7}

\upchord{Dm}\upchord{Dm}\upchord{A7sus4}\upchord{A7}x 2
Hmm, hmm, hmm...
