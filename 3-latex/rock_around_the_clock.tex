\upchord{A}One, two, three o' clock , four o' clock, rock
\upchord{A}Five, six, seven o' clock, eight o' clock, rock
\upchord{A}Nine, ten, eleven o' clock, twelve o' clock, rock.
We're gonna \upchord{E7}rock around the clock tonight.

Put your \upchord{A}glad rags on and join me, hon',
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one,
We're gonna \upchord{D7}rock around the clock tonight,
We're gonna \upchord{A}rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light
We're gonna \upchord{E7}rock, gonna rock around the clock \upchord{A}
tonight.

When the \upchord{A}clock strikes two, and three, and four,
If the band slows down we'll yell for more,
We're gonna \upchord{D7}rock around the clock tonight,
We're gonna \upchord{A}rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light,
We're gonna \upchord{E7}rock, gonna rock around the clock \upchord{A}
tonight.

\upchord{A}     \upchord{A}     \upchord{D7}     \upchord{A}     \upchord{E7}     \upchord{A}

When the \upchord{A}chimes ring five, and six, and seven,
We'll be ridin' seventh heav'n,
We're gonna \upchord{D7}rock around the clock tonight,
We're gonna \upchord{A}rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light,
We're gonna \upchord{E7}rock, gonna rock around the clock \upchord{A}
tonight.

When it's \upchord{A}eight, nine, ten, eleven too
I'll be goin' strong and so will you
We're gonna \upchord{D7}rock around the clock tonight,
We're gonna \upchord{A}rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light,
We're gonna \upchord{E7}rock, gonna rock around the clock \upchord{A}
tonight.

\textbf{Instrumental}
\upchord{A}     \upchord{A}     \upchord{D7}     \upchord{A}     \upchord{E7}     \upchord{A}

When the \upchord{A}clock strikes twelve we'll cool off then
We'll start rockin' around the clock again
We're gonna \upchord{D7}rock around the clock tonight,
We're gonna \upchord{A}rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light,
We're gonna \upchord{E7}rock, gonna rock around the clock \upchord{A}
tonight.</p>
